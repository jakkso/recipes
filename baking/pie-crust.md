## Pie Crust

### Ingredients

* Flour, 298g
* Salt, 1 tsp
* Butter, unsalted, 2 sticks
* 57-113g ice water/vodka mixture (50/50 ratio)

### Instructions

1. Whisk together flour, salt
2. Dice up butter, stick in the freezer for a few min.
3. Cut in half the butter to where itâ€™s fairly small
4. Cut in the other half, leaving it in big chunks.
5. Add the water/vodka mixture, toss with a fork, but keep it on the dry side, just enough that some of the dough will hold shape with a gentle squeeze just about a third of the mixture pretty dry.
6. Dump it all out onto parchment paper, organize it into a band, using a spray bottle, spritz any areas that are dry, then use the paper to fold the dough in on itself.  Repeat until the dough is coming together, with some dry crumbs still shedding around the edges.
7. Divide 60/40 (Bottom crust should be larger).  Pat the dough into a disk.  Wrap it up in plastic wrap or sandwich baggies, stash in fridge for 60 min.
8. Remove from the fridge, put down a floured parchment paper, roll it out between two layers of parchment paper / sheet of plastic (Think a turkey bag cut to form a single sheet.
